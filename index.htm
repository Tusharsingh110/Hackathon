    <h1>What is <span>Vocal For Local</span> all about:</h1>
    <br>
    <p>‘Vocal for Local’ is a concept which dates back to the era of the Swadeshi movement which stared in 1905 as part of the Indian independence movement. As an economic strategy, it helped develop Indian nationalism at the time. After 1947, in the 1950s and 60s we followed a conscious, socialist pattern of development to create and grow a base of domestic big industry. However, this minimized competition and also encouraged protectionism. The era of the 1990s saw a liberalization of the economies across the world, including in India. This led to an infusion of FDI and big investments from MNCs and corporate houses and several joint ventures which made India very competitive. My stint at Hindustan Unilever gave me a ringside view of large scale new investments and launch of several new product categories and acquisitions of brands. Indian IT, ITES and BPO companies were able to take advantage of this world market to become dominant global players. But this also led to a decline in some verticals in the manufacturing sector and we witnessed the emergence of South Korea, China and Taiwan as the new hubs of manufacturing<br><br>You can take pledge to Become Vocal For Local by volunteering through <a href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjHiaapzdfuAhUPIbcAHY4pBuAQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpledge.mygov.in%2Fvocalaboutlocal%2F&usg=AOvVaw3tqzitDdAkL3LFv7dn093B">this site</a>.</p>

   <li> <h1>Indian Infrastructure:</h1></li>
    <p>The most important reason for being part of this “vocal for local” wagon is that this is purely for Indians and by the Indians. The Indian Government is encouraging the nation to start using products that are made by Indian raw materials, in Indian certified facilities and by Indian skilled labour. The ideology behind this is simple- the quality of Indian raw materials is going to be fresher and rich in quality as compared to the stale and cheap quality imports.</p>
    <li> <h1>Healthy Indian grocery:</h1></li>
      <p>To cater to the changed behaviour during the pandemic, Pansari Group made it a point that the public is able to consume products such as cooking oil, rice, flour that are of the highest quality and made by the safest techniques; it has seen a massive hike of 35% as consumers have chosen their products for its nutritional value, hygienic and safe production, efficient supply chain and most importantly because of being a premium quality Indian FMCG product.<br><br>You can check the process, quality , management and other aspects of Indian Food Processing techniques and methods <a href="https://www.ibef.org/industry/indian-food-industry.aspx">here</a>.</p>
      <li> <h1>Revamp of Traditional Products:</h1></li>
    <p>There is no doubt that India has ocean of natural resources especially when it comes to fruits and dry fruits but in the past, it has been observed that fruits being exported from foreign countries like kiwi, strawberries and plums have overshadowed homegrown traditional items such as apples, pears, walnuts, almonds and other dry fruits. Therefore, experts believe that the call for vocal for local will allow these traditional products to make a comeback into the market, if the Indian FMCG companies can develop organic and healthy products from these products along with business models that are self-reliant through a strong value chain via brand, package, price and channels.<br><br>Below are some pictures of Indian Traditional Products</p>

  <li> <h1>Opportunity for <span>INDIA</span> in <span>CORONA</span> Period:</h1></li>
  <p>The Prime Minister made it clear that he is committed to remove all domestic hurdles before manufacturing and attract a share of the global value chain (which is now concentrated in China).While liquidity issues are separately handled by the Reserve Bank of India, Modi promised “bold reforms” in removing obstacles in the areas of labour, land and law. He has also promised to create world-class infrastructure.
    The reasons are apparent. There is a consensus across the world against concentration of the value chain in China. This is both due to business risks as is made evident by Covid-19 as well as due to strategic reasons.
    The US may have access to technology in pharmaceuticals but 80 per cent of its API comes from China. For India, the average is 65-70 per cent. To reduce this dependence, India is setting up eight bulk drugs parks. The pandemic may make it easier to implement this plan.
    Significantly, the Prime Minister didn’t make any mention of China or issues other than those which are domestic in nature. However, he stoked nationalism (a tool used by China to the maximum degree) in giving a call to promote local industry.
    It would, however, be naive to assume that Modi is merely taking his chances in view of the current controversy and disruption in global value chain. It is also immature to assume that the Prime Minister’s call for self-reliance is built on the anti-globalisation narrative. 
    While South Korean and Japanese companies may relocate due to political risks, American and European companies may not.<br><br>
    Also, China has been quick to restart the economy and a simple tweak in the exchange rate of RMB may see many companies drop their relocation plans for higher profits. After all, relocation is not an easy affair, and China, having built a critical mass, offers a better ecosystem for industry.</p>
